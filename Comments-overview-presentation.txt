Group 21,

Your presentation went pretty well.  You had good energy for your presentation, but try to make sure that you don't detract too much from limited presentation time with amusing examples -- 10 minutes isn't a lot.  Overall, you had a solid discussion of the purpose and goal of the application; you definitely hit the purpose of an overview on the head.

It was good to see that you had a UML diagram, but it wasn't legible on the projector; try to simplify UML diagrams by removing classes, methods, and attributes which aren't necessary for the purpose of the presentation.

You had a good Q&A, too.  My largest complaint about the entire presentation is really just that you weren't ready to present at your start time.  Make sure you have the right equipment for the final.  :)

Total Score: 92/100

Group 21,

Overall, I'm quite optimistic about the start of your project.  Your Iteration 1 submission appears to be quite complete.

Your features list is fairly complete but not terribly descriptive.  At this point in the document, I don't know what a "wish list" is.  Small sentences might make more sense here, e.g. "Tracks a wishlist of items a user wants to get via trading."

Your actors list and use cases are thorough, but there does not appear to be a use case for passive searching.  This is the main appeal to novelty in your application, so its use case should be discussed.

Beyond this, my only complaint is the mild syntactic error in your activity diagram.  Each decision should start with a diamond and end with a diamond.  Your diagram has three diamonds; this is sort of like an expression with three parentheses.

As stated above, though, everything seems to be progressing quite well.  Keep up the good work.  :)

Total Score: 95/100

Group 21,

Overall, it looks like things are going splendidly well.  You have end-to-end paths working and a lot of good code written.

I noticed that the test file that's committed to your repository describes some... interesting properties about Graham.  This is perhaps more information than I wanted about your group for the purposes of a class project.  Just saying.  (Also, test content like that should rarely be committed to the repository unless it's used by some of the tools or placed in a resources directory containing that sort of thing.)

I didn't see any unit tests for the server.  Since that's where all of your interesting logic will live (e.g. creating accounts, populating inventory, suggesting passive trades, etc.), you need to have a unit testing framework there.  (Integration tests on the server can even be performed using local curl calls or an artifical page whose purpose is to execute queries when you press a button.)  Unit tests are required for Iteration 4.

I was happy to see the comments on the client.  Comments on the server side seem a little sparse; they mostly appear to be automatically generated by the template/framework you are using.  You'll have more to comment, though, once you implement the interesting passive trading logic.

Otherwise, though, keep up the good work.  :)

Total Score: 97/100

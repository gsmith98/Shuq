Group 21,

It looks like your Iteration 3 submission is a good start.  You made a fair amount of progress on the UI itself and you've looked into a number of technologies.

The server doesn't seem to be doing much at the moment.  This is likely due to the amount of work you've been doing in learning the technology, but it would be good to see some amount of persistence working by this point; the persistence layer of a network application is often complex enough to be given its own tier in architectural diagrams.  Your use of node.js seems to be well-established (in that you've constructed a template application on which you can build), but your domain model and persistence mechanism should be at least partially implemented by this point.

As I mentioned during our conversation, I'd recommend the use of a library to handle the network protocol for you.  JSON-RPC 2 is a good protocol (especially for cross-language projects) which makes it possible to send requests and receive responses in the form of objects without having to worry about the specifics of serialization or matching a request with a response.  Otherwise, you'll have to do a lot more work than you'd like (or need to), and you honestly have more interesting things to be doing.  :)

I agree with your Iteration 4 plan to complete a full circuit operation of adding an item.  You should probably also aim to make sure authentication works by that point; it's another full circuit operation and one that will take you a little time; it's also difficult to integrate later on.  In general, make sure you integrate the remainder of the technology you intend to use.  The nice thing about these full circuit operations is that they exercise everything you'll need to implement the rest of your application; after the first full circuit, the second is much easier.  :)

Don't forget the unit tests!

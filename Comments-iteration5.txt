Group 21,

Again, this iteration seems to be solid work.  Congratulations on getting to the alpha release stage.

When I said in class that it wasn't necessarily feasible to test the user interface, I didn't give you clearance to include no unit tests at all.  My comments from Iteration 4 complained of a lack of *server* unit tests, which can be executed with no UI at all.  At the least, you should be able to write a page which, when visited, executes a series of operations using the server model to make sure that everything is in good shape and running properly.

My previous complaint about comment sparsity also seems to apply (again on the server side).  Please make sure your code is documented for this upcoming iteration.

Otherwise, however, congratulations on a job well done.  :)

Total Score: 96/100
